# Not Everything Is Lush (DLL)
 
Cross-platform console application written in C# which checks a user input stream for the string 'lush' and replaces is with any other adjective. 

**Usage:**
Windows: Run 'notEverythingIsLush.exe'
Mac: Run 'dotnet notEverythingIsLush'

The program waits for user input. Type "These mountains are lush" and it will suggest an alternative phrasing. 

Created to help Alan expand his descriptive verbosity.
